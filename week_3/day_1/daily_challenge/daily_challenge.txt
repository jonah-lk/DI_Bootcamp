Case Study: What the Study of Bodies in Herculaneum and Pompeii Taught Us
Scientists have used modern data analysis to study the bodies found in Herculaneum and Pompeii,
two cities destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE.
Researchers analyzed skeletons, teeth, and even DNA. They used tools such as CT scans, chemical testing,
and statistical comparisons to learn about diet, health, age, and lifestyle.
Data analysis showed what the average Roman ate, how healthy they were, how long they lived,
and what kinds of jobs they might have had. For example, chemical tests revealed that many people ate a lot of seafood,
and bone analysis showed differences in nutrition between social classes.
Without data analysis, we would only have guesses based on old writings or art.
Data allowed researchers to make clear, evidence-based conclusions about everyday Roman life.
This helped historians better understand how ordinary people lived, worked, and survived in the 1st century.
