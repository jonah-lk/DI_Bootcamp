# Data analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, interpreting, and drawing conclusions from data.
# Its goal is to turn raw information into meaningful insights that can support decision-making.
# Why data analysis is important today:
# In the modern world, huge amounts of data are generated every second; from phones, computers, businesses, and sensors.
# Data analysis helps organizations make informed decisions, improve efficiency, understand trends, and solve problems.
# It also supports innovation by revealing patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed.

# Three areas where data analysis is applied:
# Business and Marketing: Companies analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and market patterns to improve products, personalize advertising, and increase profits.
# Healthcare: Hospitals and researchers use data analysis to track diseases, improve diagnostics, evaluate treatments, and manage patient records more effectively.
# Finance: Banks and financial institutions analyze data to detect fraud, assess risks, automate trading, and make investment decisions.
