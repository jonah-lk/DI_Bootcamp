# Challenge 2: Affordable Items
# Goal: Create a program that prints a list of items that can be purchased with a given amount of money.
# Key Python Topics:
# Dictionaries
# Loops (for loop)
# Conditional statements (if, else)
# String manipulation (replace())
# Type conversion (int())
# Lists
# Sorting (sorted())
# Instructions:
# 1. Store Data:
# You will be provided with a dictionary (items_purchase) where the keys are the item names and the values are their prices (as strings with a dollar sign).
# The priority is defined by the position of the item on the dictionary: from the most important to the less important.
# You will also be given a string (wallet) representing the amount of money you have.
# 2. Data Cleaning:
# You need to clean the dollar sign and the commas using python. Don’t hard code it.
# 3. Determining Affordable Items:
# create a list called basket and add there the items that you can buy with the money you have on the wallet
# Don’t forget to update the wallet after buying an item.
# If the basket is empty (no items can be afforded), return the string “Nothing”.
# Otherwise, print the basket list in alphabetical order.
# 4. Examples:
# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Water": "$1", "Bread": "$3", "TV": "$1,000", "Fertilizer": "$20"}
# wallet = "$300"
# The output should be: ["Bread", "Fertilizer", "Water"].
# Given:
items_purchase = {"Apple": "$4", "Honey": "$3", "Fan": "$14", "Bananas": "$4", "Pan": "$100", "Spoon": "$2"}
wallet = "$100"
# The output should be: ["Apple", "Bananas", "Fan", "Honey", "Spoon"].
# Given:
# items_purchase = {"Phone": "$999", "Speakers": "$300", "Laptop": "$5,000", "PC": "$1200"}
# wallet = "$1"
# The output should be: "Nothing".
