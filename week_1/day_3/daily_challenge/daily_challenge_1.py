# Challenge 1: Letter Index Dictionary
# Goal: Create a dictionary that stores the indices (number of the position) of each letter in a word provided by the user(input()).
# Key Python Topics:
# User input (input())
# Dictionaries
# Loops (for loop)
# Conditional statements (if, else)
# String manipulation
# Lists
# Instructions:
# 1. User Input:
# Ask the user to enter a word.
# Store the input word in a variable.
word = input('Give a word\t')
# 2. Creating the Dictionary:
# Iterate through each character of the input word using a loop.
# And check if the character is already a key in the dictionary.
#     * If it is, append the current index to the list associated with that key.
#     * If it is not, create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
# Ensure that the characters (keys) are strings.
# Ensure that the indices (values) are stored in lists.
# 3. Expected Output:
# For the input “dodo”, the output should be: {"d": [0, 2], "o": [1, 3]}.
# For the input “froggy”, the output should be: {"f": [0], "r": [1], "o": [2], "g": [3, 4], "y": [5]}.
# For the input “grapes”, the output should be: {"g": [0], "r": [1], "a": [2], "p": [3], "e": [4], "s": [5]}.

for i in range(len(word)):
    if word[i] in char_dict.keys():
        char_dict[word[i]].append(i)
    else:
        char_dict[word[i]] = [i]
print(f'{word}: {char_dict}')
