The sky folded itself into soft ribbons of violet as the wind drifted over the quiet hills.
A lantern flickered on a wooden porch, painting trembling shapes across the ground.
Somewhere far behind the trees, a clock chimed—slow, heavy, and thoughtful—
as if measuring time by emotion rather than numbers.
